lymphoblast,"Often referred to as a blast cell. Unlike other usages of the suffix -blast a lymphoblast is a further differentiation of a lymphocyte, T- or B-, occasioned by an antigenic stimulus. The lymphoblast usually develops by enlargement of a lymphocyte, active re-entry to the S phase of the cell cycle, mitogenesis and production of much m-RNA and ribosomes.",,,,,sourceCell,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/bto/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FBTO_0000772,,string,biospecimen
